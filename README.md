Prompt manager


simple prompt manager that automates building prompt tasks please lets make it as simple as possible
this is what it will do it will ask you a list of filenames that are text based. and it will make a brand new text file in the desired output format which will be decided by the user but the options are initially markdown format  but later we will make it compatible with properly structured json and normal text .txt . this is to automate required copy and pasting into roo cline where i try to maximize the size of the initial prompt to save up on cost and get more production per session using claude 3.5 sonnet
